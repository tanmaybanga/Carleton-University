Sister Golden Hair -America

verse1:
Well i [E] tried to make it sunday but i [G#min] got so damned depressed
That i [A] set my sights on [E] monday and i [G#min] got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the alter, but i [C#min] do [G#min] believe there's [A] times
When a [F#min] woman sure can [A] be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E]

verse2:
Well i [E] keep on thinkin bout you sister [G#min] golden hair surprise

I've been [A] one poor corre[F#min]spondent, i've been [C#min] too too [G#min] hard to [A] find
But it [F#min] doesn't mean you [A] ain't been on my [E] mind [Esus2] [E]

chorus:
Will you [B] meet me in the middle will you [A] meet me in the [E] end
Will you [B] love me just a little just en[A]ough to show you [E] care
Well i [F#min] tried to fake it i [G#min] don't mind sayin i [A] just can't make it
